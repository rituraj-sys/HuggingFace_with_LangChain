# Hugging Face Model Invocation Using LangChain

This project demonstrates the use of the **Hugging Face Transformers API** with **LangChain** to invoke pre-trained language models such as `GPT-2` and `Mistral`. The project highlights how to directly use these models for generating responses to input prompts without building a complete question-answering bot.

---

## Features
- Integration with Hugging Face-hosted models via LangChain.
- Example usage of the `GPT-2` and `Mistral` models for text generation.
- Adjustable parameters such as `max_length`, `temperature`, and `API key`.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Hugging Face Transformers API**
- **LangChain** for managing model invocation.
